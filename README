# perp: persistent process supervision

# ===

This is perp, aka "the perpetrator", a persistent process supervisor.

The perp package provides a set of daemons and utilities to reliably
start, monitor, log, and control a collection of persistent processes.

-Huh?

A "persistent process" is defined as any long-running program,
normally starting at system boot and intended to continue running
until system shutdown.  Also known and often described as a "service",
a persistent process generally provides some essential, on-demand,
system service.  Programs that serve email, domain name queries,
and http requests are all examples of services that are normally
run as persistent processes.

-So?

perp provides a portable, uniform framework for installing such
services on any un!x platform, initializes services reliably within
a consistent process environment, and makes sure they continue to
run and log untended for as long as necessary.

-Says you!

Sigh...
