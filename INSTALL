SYNOPSIS

  $ vi conf.mk
  $ make && make strip
  $ su
  # make install
  # perp-setup /etc/perp


DESCRIPTION

The build system and source code are intended to be generic and
portable.

Using your preferred text editor, open the file "conf.mk" in the
top-level directory to configure the compiler, the compiler options,
and the installation directories:

  $ vi conf.mk

As an unprivileged user, build the software with:

  $ make

The system is intended to be make(1) "agnostic", and should build
correctly with any standard make provided with either BSD or Linux
systems.

Strip debugging symbols for smaller executables:

  $ make strip

To install the compiled binaries and man pages, gain administrator
privilege and run:

  $ su
  # make install

The software is now installed on the system.


ACTIVATION

Before activating the software for the first time, take some moments
to become familiar with its configuration and operation.  In particular,
skim the manual pages for perp_intro(8), perpd(8), perpetrate(8), and
perpetrate(5).

It is recommended to use perpboot(8) to start and log the perp
system.  The perp-setup(8) utility may be used to automatically
install and configure perpboot(8) into the system's init(8) scripts,
whether System-V style (/etc/inittab) or BSD style (/etc/rc.local):

  # perp-setup /etc/perp

Review the startup scripts now installed in /etc/perp/.boot and
the perpboot(8) stanza added to either /etc/inittab or /etc/rc.local.

Activation of the system then depends on the host system.  If
System-V style (/etc/inittab), just send a SIGHUP to init(8):

  # kill -HUP 1

If BSD-style (/etc/rc.local), you will need to reboot the machine:

  # shutdown -r now

The perp system will then be activated and services may be added to
/etc/perp at anytime.


EXAMPLES

The examples subdirectory in the distribution package contains a small
collection of ready-made service definitions.  The README file in that
directory, and with each example service definition, explains its usage
and installation procedure.
