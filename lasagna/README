This is libasagna, or "-lasagna", a cheesy high-cholesterol general
purpose utility library for programming on Un!x.

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

Please note: this version of the library is intended only to support
the specific project that accompanies it.  The interfaces and function
definitions are otherwise under continuous development, and will
vary from release to release, and from project to project.


USAGE

Build the library (should be make-agnostic):

  vi ../conf.mk
  make

Compile and link:

  gcc -c foo.c -I/path/to/lasagna
  gcc -o foo foo.o -L/path/to/lasagna -lasagna


MODULES

The library provides a set of purpose-specific modules described by
their header files:

    buf.h       operations on byte buffers
    cstr.h      operations on C strings (nul-terminated char buffers)
    devout.h    unbuffered write()
    dynbuf.h    dynamic (growable) buffers
    dynstr.h    dynamic (growable) strings
    dynstuf.h   dynamic (growable) "stuff"
    execvx.h    extended execve()
    fd.h        operations on file descriptors
    ioq.h       fully buffered i/o
    ioq_std.h   predefined ioq's for stdin, stdout, stderr
    newenv.h    setup environment for child process
    nextopt.h   command-line option parser
    nfmt.h      format (stringify) numbers
    nscan.h     convert numeric string to number
    outvec.h    semi-buffered output using writev()
    packet.h    [cruft]
    padlock.h   posix advisory locking
    pidlock.h   lockfile with process id
    pkt.h       tiny packet protocol
    rlimit.h    resource limits
    sig.h       signal handlers
    sigset.h    operations on sigsets
    sysstr.h    stringify errno and signals
    tain.h      nano-second precision tai
    tx64.h      base64 encoding
    uchar.h     typedef for unsigned char
    upak.h      portable unsigned integer storage


DESIGN

In general, the library attempts to provide a consistent design
interface following an object_method(target, args) style of
function definition.

Operations that return an int value for reporting success/failure
follow the convention of returning 0 for success (no error), and
-1 for failure, setting errno where appropriate.

Operations that return a pointer value follow the convention of
returning NULL for failure, setting errno where appropriate.

Otherwise, functions are generally designed to return a useful
value.

The library is modularized and factored into discrete function
objects to help the linker make small statically-linked binaries.


DOCUMENTATION

Some documentation and usage notes may be found in the header files
for each module.  Otherwise, no separate documentation is currently
available.


REFERENCES

Much of the source code, algorithms, and design philosophy is
originally based on the public domain libraries included with the
"daemontools" project by Dan Bernstein:

  http://cr.yp.to/daemontools/

Sources and documentation may describe this reference as "djb".

This library is intended to be "portable" among contemporary Un!x
systems that adhere to generally accepted "posix" standards.  Sigh,
whatever that means.  In practice this library has been used
successfully on Linux/glibc, Linux/dietlibc, and NetBSD.  The
library is very general will probably work on any system that
supports poll().  It is otherwise designed and implemented to work
on all the systems described in:

  Advanced Unix Programming in the UNIX Environment, Second Edition
  W. Richard Stevens and Stephen A. Rago
  2005, Addison-Wesley

Sources and documentation may describe this reference as "APUE/2e".

The sources are defined for "Standard C" compilers following the
C89 specification as described in:

  C  A Reference Manual, Fifth Edition
  Samuel P. Harbison III and Guy L. Steel Jr.
  2002, Prentice-Hall

Sources and documentation may describe this reference as "CARM/5e".

Finally, no list of references would be complete without mentioning
this fine manual:

  The Practice of Programming
  Brian W. Kernighan and Rob Pike
  1999, Addison-Wesley

As much as this code fails to attain the wisdom embodied in this
slim book, it nevertheless aspires to it.
